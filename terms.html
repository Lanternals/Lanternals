            <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">Edits and Redesigns</h1>
            <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
                <li>If it is your own design, you can change large parts of the design including traited items as long as it is within the same rarity and you have the appropriate shop item. However, you cannot change a design between a Lanternal and a Grimhalla. Once it is designed it must stay that species.</li>
                <li>In the case of an adopt or custom, you must have the original artist and/or designer's permission to redesign the Lanternal, and you must follow that artist's redesign TOS, if they have one, along with the following rules:</li>
                <li>Redesigns must keep all traits of the previous Masterlist design. The redesign must resemble the original by at least 80%. (80% is visually subjective. Go with your gut here people)</li>
           <li>The only exception to the above is if you have the specific redesign shop items.</li>
                <li>These rules are in place to keep the original design from becoming unrecognizable, and to try and protect the original artists intentions. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to DM an owner or mod through toyhouse or discord, or ask in the questions channel of the server.</li>

            <h4 class="text-muted mb-3">Redesign Terms</h4>
            <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
                 <li>These changes are considered redesigns and MUST be submitted for reapproval:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Adding/tweaking/removing TRAITED characteristics. Link to the appropriate shop item. If there is not a shop item for what youâ€™d like to do, feel free to ask and weâ€™ll discuss it. Traited characteristics include the shape of the rib cage, the ashmarks, the color of the core, etc.</li>
                 <li>Body type edits. Changes must be within reason. Drastic changes in body type, such as making plus-sized characters thin, will NOT be approved.</li>
                <li>Skin tone edits. Skin tone changes are allowed, as long as the new skin tone is within the same range of the old one. Whitewashing or drastically changing a character's race is NOT allowed. This does not apply to a skin tone looking altered due to the nature of a piece, like a scene with dramatic blue lighting or something.</li>
                <li>Hair color/Haircut edits. If you wish to drastically change a character's hair color or length/style (such as going from a blonde to a redhead), they must be approved and reuploaded onto the Masterlist first. Streaks of color are okay, but it still has to look like the same Lanternal.</li>
            </ul>
                 <li>However these features can be changed at any time without approval:</li>
                <ul>
 <li>Updating/Redrawing the reference image without changing any traits. Unless you want us to update the Masterlist image.</li>
                <li>Giving your Lanternal different outfits. Unless you want us to update the Masterlist image.</li>
                 <li>Changing the character's gender.</li>
                <li>Hairstyle edits. You may change how the hair is styled but do not alter the length, cut or color of the hair. For example, putting their hair into a ponytail.</li>
                 <li>Slight color tweaks- this means going from one shade of blue to a similar one, not changing the core from purple to green. There are applicable items for that.</li>
                     <li>Simplifying a design element OUTSIDE of traits. Such as simplifying heavily patterned clothing, complicated hairstyles, etc.</li>
